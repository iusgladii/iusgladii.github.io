        <div class="main-title">HCI Research Into Auditory Feedback for Relaxation</div>
        <div class="body-text">During the summer of 2021, I participated in the STEM Summer Research program hosted by the Undergraduate Research office at IU. The program was eight weeks long and consisted of multiple student research groups that were each led by a faculty researcher. My group was composed of one other student and I; we conducted informatics research into human-computer interaction. We were interested in analyzing how digital interfaces for audio creation and manipulation could be used in music therapy contexts. By the end of the program, I had designed and built an application that provided a heart relaxation exercise and music play-along exercise.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">Interfaces that support creation and manipulation of audio have been used in music therapy contexts for many years now. Examples include incorporating digital audio workstations and MIDI instruments into therapy sessions. Previous research has demonstrated cases where an audio feedback system can be used to help induce relaxation in the user of the system. Our group decided to design an interface that played music for the user and added colored noise sources to the music in response to the onset of cardiac acceleration.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Oftentimes, self-report surveys are collected to analyze the effect of music therapy practices. However, self-report data is susceptible to a myriad of issues such as cognitive bias. Psychophysiological measurements can cut through these issues though the techniques are usually invasive. While the invasiveness may not be an issue for research, it is an issue if we want to make the interface biologically data-driven. PPG sensors provide a good balance between user comfort and analytic power. Techniques such as electroencephalography and facial electromyography provide deep insight into information such as emotional valence, relaxation, and attention. However, the electrodes and skin/scalp preparation process are too invasive for regular therapeutic use. Photoplethysmography provides enough insight into information such as attention and relaxation while remaining relatively uninvasive.</div>
