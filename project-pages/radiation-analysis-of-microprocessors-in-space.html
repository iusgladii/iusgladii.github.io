        <div class="main-title">Radiation Analysis of Microprocessors in Space</div>
        <div class="body-text">I am currently assisting with research in the Reliable Electronics and Systems Lab at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. I am analyzing the side-channel vulnerabilities of an AES accelerator under irradiation using deep learning. We are targeting the MSP430FR6989 mixed-signal microcontroller, which sees frequent use in space applications and has a cryptographic acceleration module.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The response of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microcontrollers to total ionizing dose (TID) radiation has been evaluated for numerous internal modules, such as the ADC, SRAM, and clock system. However, there is a critical lack of research into the TID response of cryptographic modules and into any side-channel vulnerabilities the exposure creates. I am writing a paper that will present TID data on the AES accelerator in the MSP430FR6989. It will also discuss how the power consumption traces of the benchmark program for testing the AES accelerator can be used to train a deep learning model for retrieving the master key.</div>
          <div class="body-text">There are known vulnerabilities that arise with the implementation of cryptographic algorithms; differences in how a cipher treats various bit configurations of a private key can expose the key itself, such as side-channel leakage of 1 bits within the m-ary method employed by the RSA and elliptic curve cryptosystems. Radiation effects can, in principle, accentuate these differences in the SoC AES accelerator if the effects disproportionately influence the power consumption of certain block operations in the cipher.</div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image
